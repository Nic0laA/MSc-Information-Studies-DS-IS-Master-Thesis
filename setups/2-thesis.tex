% A summary of results should be included. Avoid citations. Maximum length is 200 words.

The detection and analysis of gravitational waves (GW) allows scientists to study the universe from a new perspective. Current techniques for parameter inference of GW are computationally expensive, and the substantial increase in detected events expected in the future is introducing significant data analytics challenges for the GW community. The \texttt{peregrine} analysis pipeline implements multiple sequential rounds of simulation-based inference with the U-Net CNN architecture. While this pipeline successfully performs high precision GW parameter inference, the network training time is a significant bottleneck.
In this work, we assessed several modifications of the \texttt{peregrine} pipeline, with the aim to improve the overall performance. Attention mechanisms, particularly as applied in transformer models have become very popular in recent years due to their reported high performance. We compare the performance of \texttt{peregrine} with the baseline U-Net model with several variations, including Attention U-Net, pre-trained vision transformer, pre-trained multi-variate time series transformer, and finally, structured network pruning of the original U-Net. After a thorough investigation of the most promising state-of-the-art techniques, we concluded that the original U-Net in \texttt{peregrine} is already close to optimal.

%we found no convincing evidence that these modifications improve the performance of .

%that the best performing model was the original U-Net, and that the use of larger transformer models did not provide any performance improvement. This was predominantly due to longer training times required. The pruned networks could be trained faster but suffered from poorer accuracy in later inference rounds.
