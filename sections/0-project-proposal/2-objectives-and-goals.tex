\section{Objectives \& Goals}
\label{sec:objectives_and_goals}

The objectives of the thesis can be divided into three main parts.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reproduce the results from papers \cite{bhardwaj2023peregrine} and \cite{alvey2023things}. This will form the benchmark to which the eventual results will be compared to.
\item Optimise the network architectures to reduce the simulation time while still producing the same results in \cite{bhardwaj2023peregrine} and \cite{alvey2023things}.
\item Perform a complete validation. Metrics for performance will be reproducing the coverage plots \cite{bhardwaj2023peregrine} and the required number of simulations.
\end{enumerate}

Please note, the thesis will utilise simulated data (not real gravitational wave data) since the thesis is focused on the data analysis pipeline itself, and not the physics of astronomical objects. The "ground-truth" data for validation will be the results of papers \cite{bhardwaj2023peregrine} and \cite{alvey2023things}.
